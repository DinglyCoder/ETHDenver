This program provides decentralized Human verification for X posts to guarentee a post was made by a Human.

These days, with the rise of AI agents and bot accounts, social media appears to heve fewer human-to-human interaction. There is a growing need for real conversations with real people.
We used the Humanity Protocol API to validate the credentials of a user. Once a user is validated they can submit a post on the website page which ships their post to X with a humanity verification link.
