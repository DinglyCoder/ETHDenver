Decentralized Human verification for X posts to guarentee a post was made by a Human and not a bot.

# What is the project
These days, with the rise of AI agents and bot accounts, social media appears to heve fewer human-to-human interaction. There is a growing need for real conversations with real people. We set out to create an auxilary website that can provide proof that a post on X was created and posted by a real human and not an autonomous bot.
We used the Humanity Protocol API to validate the credentials of a user. Once a user is validated they can submit a post on the website page which posts on X.com on behalf of their account with a humanity verification link. 
The Humanity Protocol API is called from a smart contract on the Chainlink Protocol. We utilize Chainlink's off-platform API calling functionality in our smart contract. This ensures a decentralized, trustless, and verifiable human authentification process.

# How to Test and Run

# Humanity Protocol Feedback
* Humanity Protocol seems to be in early stages of development so we took that into account when we encountered issues. We appreciate the dev team for responding to our questions and guiding our project.
* There wasn't clear how user credentials are collected in pracitice. Our project assumes there is a seperate credential collection service.
* Certain bugs were encountered when using the API to validate credentials
