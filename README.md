This program provides decentralized Human verification for X posts to guarentee a post was made by a Human.

# What is the project
These days, with the rise of AI agents and bot accounts, social media appears to heve fewer human-to-human interaction. There is a growing need for real conversations with real people. We set out to create an auxilary website that can provide proof that a post on X was created and posted by a real human and not an autonomous bot.
We used the Humanity Protocol API to validate the credentials of a user. Once a user is validated they can submit a post on the website page which ships their post to X with a humanity verification link.

# How to Test and Run

# Humanity Protocol Feedback

* Certain bugs were encountered when using the API to validate credentials
